Replacing these values with an average/median would be misleading to the analysis. There is also no indiciative item prices to try and make assumptions as to what the revenue might be based on nb_sold, so I decided to drop these. I can add them back in if the sales want me to. \n","\n","6. _years_as_customer_: \n","- The dtypes int64 is the correct value type. \n","- The company was founded in 1984 and there were  incorrect values in this column. I calculated number of years from today to 1984 (39), if any values were above this I replaced them with an average of the column. There were only two values that exceeded 39 so I didnt over think how to deal with these values as it wont affect the data analysis too much. \n","\n","7. _nb_site_visits_:\n","- The dtypes int64 is the correct value type and there are no negative vlaues\n","\n","8. _state_: \n","- The dtypes object is the correct value type and there were no misspelt values.\n","\n","New DF for analysis purposes:\n","- In order to gain a holistic view of most important metric,the time spent on each customer in relation to the % of revenue for each mehtod, I needed to create a new dataframe that contained the method, revenue, percentage of revenue for each method and calculate the total hours spent on each customer per method.
